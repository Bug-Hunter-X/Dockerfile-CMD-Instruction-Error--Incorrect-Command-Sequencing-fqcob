This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the CMD instruction incorrectly sequences commands, preventing proper execution of pip install and the application. The bug involves attempting to execute multiple commands within a single CMD instruction using '&&', but the commands are not properly separated and interpreted by the shell.  The solution shows the correct way to execute multiple commands, using either a shell form or an exec form, leading to successful installation and execution of the application within the Docker container.
